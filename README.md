- 👋 Hi, I’m @pfriml,
- 👀 I’m interested in Linux, OpenSource, beer <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Food/Beer%20Mug.png" alt="Beer Mug" width="25" height="25" /> and a lot of sport activities (ice hockey, beach volleyball, cycling).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Kubernetes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the DNAnexus platform <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Smilies/Heart%20on%20Fire.png" alt="Heart on Fire" width="25" height="25" />.
- 📫 How to reach me: on chat @pfriml or use my email address pfriml@dnanexus.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: Pítr.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have two daughers so you would rather find me in the office rather than working from home :-)
